# customLMS

## Customized LMS approach for FLPS models
- Customized EM algorithm is programmed for FLPS models based on `nlsem` pacakge.

- `customized_em.R` runs LMS for FLPS models (but there's no missing data. Missing data could be treated by FIML)
  - `mvtnorm` package is needed for normal density
  - `gaussquad` is needed for Hermite-Gaussian quadrature
  - `nlme::fdHess` is needed to compute Hessian matrix for SE
- `Custom_LMS.RDS` is a result of `customized_em.R`
- `Mplus_LMS.out` is a result of Mplus for benchmark

## Data

```{r, echo = F}
read_csv("test_dt.csv", col_names = F) %>% set_names(c("x1","x2","x3","x4","x5","y1"))
```



## Model

- 3 continuous indicators (x1-x3 same as v1-v3)
- One cavariate (x5 same as x)
- Treatment assignment (x4 same as z)
